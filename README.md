# ICT235-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

ICT235 will provide a comprehensive overview of fundamental data structures and algorithms essential for ICT and software engineering. It is designed to deepen understanding of data organisation, storage, and retrieval, alongside efficient algorithm design and analysis. The course is structured to build from basic concepts to more complex structures and algorithms using Python, ensuring a solid foundation for further study and practical application.

Topics
● Algorithm Analysis
● Recursion
● Array-based Sequences
● Stacks and Queues
● Linked List and Positional List
● Tree and Tree Traversal Algorithms
● Priority Queues
● Maps
● Hash
● Skip Lists
● Sorting
● Selection

This module uses Python. I have uploaded jupyter notebook for my individual assignment(TMA)
